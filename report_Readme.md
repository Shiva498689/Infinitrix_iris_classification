    Introduction :
    The code contains the two models , first is  " Logistic Regreassion Model" and second is "Linear Regression MOdel" 
    both the models work on the principle of supervised learning and learns with the labelled data availble as "iris.csv ".

    About the Dataset :
    The Dataset is taken from the kaggle with 150 datapoints but it is than mixed with some more datapoints generated by AI <br> taking it to something around 160 . The Dataset comprises of 5 Columns namely each
     { sepal lenght , sepal width , petal length ,petal width , specie}  
     where every entry except "specie" is a floating point value.
    

    Workflow of the models :

    the program firstly converts all the string labels to the class numbers can be seen as { 1 , 2 , 3} and than 
    model trains on the above specified dataset and and tan do the predictions on the test Dataset 

    *** Test Dataset is created by splitting the Train Dataset itself into 1:4 respectively .***
